#Program to find the volume of a right cone given the length
#       of the radius of the base and the height
# Preconditions: (input)
#       User supplies radius and height of the cone (as numbers, no error checking done)
# Postconditions:  (output)
#       User greeted with a message
#       Cone volume displayed
#### Design
#   1. greet the user
#   2. ask the user for the radius and height and read them in
#   3. calculate the area using the formula for volume (pi * radius * radius * height  / 3)
#   4. output the results with an appropriate label
