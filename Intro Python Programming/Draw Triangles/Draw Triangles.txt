#Purpose:
    #Program to receive three points, draw their endpoints and draw a triangle
    #connecting them and a inverse image, aslo desplay the perimeter and area
    #of the triangles, five times. Then add up and display the total area and perimeter
    #of the triangles and reflected ones.
#Preconditions: (input)
    # user will click to input where the points of the triangles.
#Postconditions: (output)
    #Display title
    #A blank line is shown
    #Ask for the first, second and third point of trianles
    #Draw each point with click with a yellow circle.
    #A blank line is shown
    #Display perimeter of each triangles
    #Display the area of the first triangle
    #A blank line is shown.
    #Repeat steps above 5 times
    #Show the total of the perimeters and areas of triangles and reflected ones
